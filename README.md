This is the repo for the Unity VR project, which aims to build and share an introduction to Unity virtual reality. The repo contains:

- The [XRInteraction Toolkit](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.xr.interaction.toolkit@2.4/manual/index.html) used for interaction system for creating -a VR experience.
- The [XR Plugin Management](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/com.unity.xr.management.html) that provides simple management of XR plug-ins.
- The code for [climbing locomotion](#climbing-locomotion).
- The code for [controllers](#controllers).
- The code for [interactables](#interactables).

## Overview 

The tutorial series introduces VR development in Unity. It covers topics like object grabbing, physics, locomotion systems, collider components, object interaction using rays, handling UI elements, distant object interaction, player movement, teleportation etc. Those who know the fundementals of Unity can work on VR development easily.

Note: This project is still under development.
